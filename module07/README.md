# Module 07: Page Objects design pattern

## Preparation:

Read
[Chapter 6. Page Objects](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/page-objects.html);

## Page object basics

Page Objects are Python classes which encapsulate page behavior and structure.
This allows a layer of separation between tests and actual page implementation.

Instructor will explain the example from the tutorial and answer questions
posted by the students.

## Tasks

Go back to the tasks from Module 06 and rewrite them using Page Objects.
Discuss your findings and issues with the instructor. Instructor will examine
the resulting test scripts and provide feedback.
