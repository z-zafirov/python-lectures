# QA automation with Python & Selenium Workshop

## Environment setup

Students need to prepare the following environment on their computers:

* Install Python 3 on your computer from https://www.python.org/downloads/;
* Text editor of choice, preferably [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/);
* Selenium & geckodriver, see [Selenium installation](../module06/#installation)

## Rules of engagement

* Each module has links and instructions for preparation. It is best to
  read all of these before the workshop;
* Workshop will explain the theory from the preparation section
  and focus on writing programs to solidify the knowledge;
* Each module is scheduled to take 1 hour;
* You have 3 lives for the entire workshop. If you don't complete
  the tasks for the given module you lose 1 life. When all of your 3 lives are lost
  it is **GAME OVER**!


**NOTES:**

* Students should be prepared beforehand since the
  workshop does not intend to focus on installation related issues!
* Students must be familiar with their tools of choice, e.g. they need to know
  how to use the IDE or text editor, how to search files, how to search for
  particular text, etc;
* Instructor may be using different text editor and operating system and may not be
  able to help with matters related to any particular tool if they are not obvious
  enough;
* Students are advised to use the same tools so they can help each other;
