# Module 08: Writing automated tests for real scenarios

## Preparation:

Students need to prepare 3 to 5 real-world test scenarios.
These scenarios need to be defined in enough details so that it is
evident what actions need to be executed and how the resulting conditions
will be tested!


Please use
[Given-When-Then](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Given-When-Then)
to describe your scenarios.

**TIPS:** 
- define small scenrios, e.g. visit a web page, perform only 1 action
  and inspect the results
- Sites that can be used for testing:
  - http://shop.pragmatic.bg
  - https://mozillians.org
- Open source projects which could use your help
  - [Kiwi TCMS](http://kiwitcms.org) - provides docker compose to run the
    application. Needs lots of Selenium based tests!


## Tasks

* Start from the easiest scenario and write automated test using Selenium
* Continue automating the rest of you scenarios
